## Project Background

Echo Circuit, an emerging e-commerce company launched in North West England, specialising in selling electronic components for home appliances made a strategic decision to expand into other regions in 2019.  In April and May they had a "Spring Clean" sale, which was promoted nationwide. Whilst in August, a similar budget for a "Summer Sale" promotion was spent but targeted at the Greater London and West Midlands regions.

I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations on campaign timing and targeting to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

**Note:** The business migrated historical data over to a new CRM system at the end of February. Several users have expressed concern over data integrity. I will also find errors and suggest fixes.

## Executive Summary

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Sales Trends and Growth Rates

- Echo Circuit averaged £2000 revenue per month for 2019.
- Sales surge after February, with a average monthly revanue increasing by 340% (£500 to £2300).
- Noticeable peak in November revenue (£3000) due to slightly higher than normal number of transactions (57) and AOV (£51.00). Suggesting seasonality, possibly certain appliances are more likely to break in the winter.
- Without Outlier months (Jan, Feb, Nov) and discount purchases, monthly revenue is stable (£1900). Can expect this performance if no promotions or sales in 2020.
- Noticeable peak in revenue for May (£3000) and August (£3500). Suggesting efficacy of the company's promotions.

### Regional Analysis

### Loyalty Program Performance

### Data Integrity (??Maybe remove and put in own subheader, remember to remove from project background and change repo description??)

## Key Insisghts (??Maybe remove and just put points in Executie summry at end of project??)

- Nationwide expansion had a considerable effect
- November is by far the most successful month (no discount purchases)
- On average approx. £2,000/month (no discount purchases)
- Nationwide promotions need time to take effect
- Summer Sale was far more successful than Spring Clean – targeted promotions are far more effective
- Greater London slightly more responsive to Summer Sale than West Midlands
- North West seems most responsive to promotions – a North West targeted campaign may be successful
