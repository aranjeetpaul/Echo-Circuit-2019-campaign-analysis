## Project Background

Echo Circuit, an emerging e-commerce company launched in North West England, specialising in selling electronic components for common home appliances made a strategic decision to expand into other regions in 2019.  In April and May they had a "Spring Clean" sale, which was promoted nationally. Whilst in August, a similar budget for promotion was spent but targeted at the Greater London and West Midlands regions.

I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations on campaign timing and targeting to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

**Note:** The business migrated historical data over to a new CRM system at the end of February. Several users have expressed concern over data integrity. I will also find errors and suggest fixes.

### Data Integrity (??Maybe remove and put in own subheader, remember to remove from project background and change repo description??)

## Key Insisghts (??Maybe remove and just put points in Executie summry at end of project??)

- Nationwide expansion had a considerable effect
- November is by far the most successful month (no discount purchases)
- On average approx. £2,000/month (no discount purchases)
- Nationwide promotions need time to take effect
- Summer Sale was far more successful than Spring Clean – targeted promotions are far more effective
- Greater London slightly more responsive to Summer Sale than West Midlands
- North West seems most responsive to promotions – a North West targeted campaign may be successful
